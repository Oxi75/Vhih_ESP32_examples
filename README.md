# Vhih_ESP32_examples
On this repositry I'd like to provide some examples how to control different devices connected on a ESP32 with homee smart home central.
As development environment Arduino IDI 2.2.1 (or newer) is recommended. 
The examples should also work with an ESP8266 but I have never tested it!

# general dependencies
The underlaying API developed by DanielKoop: https://github.com/DanielKnoop/homee-api-esp32
Some of the examples are also taken from there and where modified slightly.

# dependencies for ESP32
    * ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon >= 6.21.3 (via Arduino library manager)
    * ESPAsyncWebServer >= 1.2.7 (https://github.com/DanielKnoop/ESPAsyncWebServer)
    * AsyncTCP >= 1.1.4 (https://github.com/dvarrel/AsyncTCP)

# dependencies for ESP8266 (not tested!!)
   * ArduinoJson 6.17.3 (bblanchon)
   * ESPAsyncWebServer 1.2.7 (https://github.com/DanielKnoop/ESPAsyncWebServer)
   * ESPAsyncTCP 1.2.2 (https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP)
   * ESPAsyncUDP (https://github.com/DanielKnoop/ESPAsyncUDP)


I have no connection to homee GmbH or to codeatelier GmbH.
